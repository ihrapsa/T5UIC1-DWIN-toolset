## Tools:
This repo contains a series of tools and application guides to drive the **T5UIC1** DWIN display that comes with some 3d  printers like: _**Creality Ender 3 V2**_ or _**Voxelab Aquila**_. This type of display is controlled by another mcu through a series of serial instructions described in the **Kernel Application Guide** document. The current version of the **Ender 3 V2** display kernel is **v2.0** but the dwin website only has the v1.2 in english. However, I've found the chinese version for v2.0 and used an online transaltor to translate it to english. Both versions are provided.

While browsing through the dwin dev forum I found a series of tools for this type of display:  

* **SSCOM - Serial Debugging tool** - A tool to communicate with serial devices. You need to know the hex instrucions to handshake and control the display (you can find tehm inside aplication guide document).

	</details> 

* **Tool for T5UIC1** - Contains all the necessary tools to communicate with the display, create `.ICO` files, upload/create `HZK` fonts, edit the `.cfg` file and some other. The GUI facilitates some steps that you'd have to manually do with the sscom.
