## Tools:
This repo contains a series of tools and Application guides to drive the **T5UIC1** DWIN display. This type of display is controlled by another mcu through a series of serial instructions described in the **Kernel Application Guide** document. The current version of the **Ender 3 V2** display kernel is **v2.0** but the dwin website only has the v1.2 in english. While browsing through the dwin dev forum I found a series of tools for this type of display:  

* **SSCOM - Serial Debugging tool** - A tool to communicate with serial devices. You need to know the hex instrucions to handshake and control the display (you can find tehm inside aplication guide document).

	</details> 

* **Tool for T5UIC1** - Contains all the necessary tools to communicate with the display, create `.ICO` files, upload/create `HZK` fonts, edit the `.cfg` file and some other. The GUI facilitates some steps that you'd have to manually do with the sscom.

* **DWIN ToolBox** - Contains a series of tools (some are included in the Tool for T5UIC1 as well) but this is not exclusivly designed for T5UIC1
